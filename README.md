# Pharmacy Billing FS Project

### In this project, we are managing the Medicines inventory using hashing, and have the option to generate Bills stored using hashing as well.

### And as well are we going to provide a web interface to see the changes in the browser.

Steps to execute the program:

Open `powershell` and move to the folder Pharmacy (The Project Folder), and then run the following commands:

```shell
python Project.py
```

Open `powershell` in another terminal, and run the following command:

```shell
python web-interface.py
```

### That's it, voila!
